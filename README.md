# heli-storm
Just a quick game example using pixi.js.

Make the helicopter go past the storm:

Mouse left click to give the helicopter torque. It'll follow your mouse Y axis coordinates. Dodge the wind!

This was made for educational purposes only.
Feel free to grab the code for whatever you need, but not the assets as I don't own them.
